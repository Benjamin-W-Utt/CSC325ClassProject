#### **Scenario**:
David has been tasked with implementing a responsive design for the personal portfolio website. His job is to ensure that the site not only looks great but works seamlessly on all devices, from desktop to mobile.

David starts by implementing the basic structure of the website using HTML and CSS. He works closely with the design team to integrate the chosen color schemes, fonts, and layouts. After finalizing the structure, he begins adding interactivity using JavaScript. For example, he makes sure that the project gallery is dynamic, allowing users to filter projects by technology used, and that each project links to its corresponding GitHub repository or live demo.

When he works on the contact form, David ensures that the form submits successfully to a backend service and integrates email notifications for potential employers. He also adds validation to make sure users don’t submit incomplete or incorrect information.

Once the site is ready for testing, David performs cross-browser compatibility testing, ensuring the site loads properly on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. He also runs performance checks, optimizing images, minifying code, and implementing lazy loading to improve site speed.

As the site goes live, David continues to monitor its performance, addressing any bug reports from end users and making regular updates to improve security and usability.

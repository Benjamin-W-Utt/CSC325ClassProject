#### **Scenario**:
Sarah is conducting a hiring search for a junior software developer position in her marketing agency. She comes across a portfolio for a candidate, John Doe, that has been shared with her via LinkedIn. 

When she clicks on the portfolio, the website loads quickly, and the layout is clean and professional. She sees a brief "About Me" section with John’s academic background and personal interests. The next section shows his technical skills, and she is able to easily view his projects. Sarah clicks on one project and is able to access a detailed explanation of John’s role in the project, the technologies he used, and a link to the live project or GitHub repository. This gives Sarah an immediate sense of his abilities and work style.

Sarah is impressed with the straightforward design and finds a button at the top of the portfolio to download John’s resume, which she does to review offline. When finished, she clicks on the “Contact” section and is able to send John a message via an integrated contact form, all without having to leave the site.

Thanks to the clean, intuitive interface, Sarah can quickly evaluate John’s fit for the position and reach out to schedule an interview—without feeling overwhelmed by information. The experience makes her more likely to return to this portfolio or recommend it to colleagues in the future.

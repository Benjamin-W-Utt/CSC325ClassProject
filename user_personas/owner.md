#### **Scenario**:
John is a third-year computer science student preparing to apply for summer internships in the tech industry. As part of his job search strategy, he decides to create a personal portfolio to showcase his projects, technical skills, and resume. He wants to ensure his portfolio is polished and professional, but he lacks design experience.

He works with a team that helps him build the portfolio, focusing on highlighting his coding projects (such as web apps, mobile apps, and software tools he’s developed), along with detailed descriptions of the technologies used, his role in the project, and links to GitHub repositories.

John spends time curating his best work for the portfolio, making sure each project demonstrates his problem-solving skills and ability to work in teams. He also includes a clean "About Me" section where he talks about his background, academic interests, and career goals. Once the website is live, John shares the portfolio link in his job applications and on his LinkedIn profile.

John's portfolio helps him land an interview with a leading tech company. The clean, easy-to-navigate design, combined with detailed project descriptions and a downloadable resume, makes it easy for hiring managers to quickly assess his abilities.

# User Personas

This directory contains detailed user personas that represent key stakeholders involved in the **Crafting a Personal Online Portfolio for Career Advancement** project. These personas are used to better understand the needs, behaviors, and goals of different users who will interact with the personal portfolio website.

## Purpose

The purpose of creating user personas is to ensure that the website design, content, and features cater to the specific needs and expectations of each stakeholder. This helps to create a more targeted, user-friendly portfolio that will have the greatest impact on potential employers and other audiences.

## Key Stakeholders

The user personas in this directory will represent the following key stakeholders:

1. **Potential Employers**: Hiring managers, recruiters, or company representatives who will evaluate the portfolio to assess the student's qualifications, technical skills, and fit for potential job roles.

2. **Owner**: The person or entity that owns the rights to the software and oversees its development and distribution, who is represented by the website whose information will make up the main content. 

3. **Developers**: Web developers working collaboratively to construct the website and organize its content, responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining the software.

## Directory Structure

Each user persona is represented by a separate file in this directory. The file names follow this structure:

- `persona_name.md`

Each file contains the following information about the persona:

- **Name**: The persona's name or identifier.
- **Role/Title**: The persona's professional or academic role.
- **Demographics**: Key demographic details (age, education, background).
- **Goals**: What the persona hopes to achieve by interacting with the website.
- **Frustrations**: Potential pain points or challenges the persona may face.
- **Narrative**: A brief narrative or scenario illustrating how they interact with the software

## How to Use the User Personas

These personas are designed to inform decisions about the portfolio's structure, design, and content. Hereâ€™s how you can use them:

- **Content Creation**: Tailor your portfolio's messaging to align with the needs and goals of each persona.
- **Design Decisions**: Ensure that the layout and user experience are optimized for the different technology comfort levels of the personas.
- **Feature Prioritization**: Focus on adding features that address the specific frustrations and needs of each persona.
- **Usability Testing**: When testing the portfolio, consider how each persona would interact with the website and whether their goals are met effectively.

# Crafting a Personal Online Portfolio for Career Advancement

## Project Description

The website will serve as a professional online presence that highlights the student's technical acumen, problem-solving abilities, and creativity. Additionally, the portfolio will be designed to generate leads from potential employers by providing a user-friendly interface, relevant content, and effective call-to-action features.

- **Project Portfolio**: A collection of academic and personal projects and experiences, with descriptions, technologies used, and links to source code or live demos.
- **Blog Integration**: Collection of articles written by the student providing insight regarding computer science and technology.
- **Resume Download**: A feature to download the latest version of the student's resume in PDF format.
- **Contact Form**: A simple, yet effective contact form for potential employers or collaborators to get in touch.
- **Call-to-Action**: Clear calls-to-action encouraging visitors to get in touch, request more information, or view additional content.
